# Constitutional rules 

The goal of the rules is to ensure automatic executability of the democratic and
planning mechanisms. This requires a mechanical definition of rules whenever
possible. Since the system runs in a society (nation state(s)) that it is
embedded in, it can also use legal contracts to enforce rules and interaction
with the outside world. Each plan executed by the system might provide
additional rules and legal constructs that are overwritten by the the
constitutional rules.

Rules can be mechanical (M), then they will be executed from the smart contract
of the constitution. And they can be legal (L), then they will be enforced by
the underlying legal system. The legal obligations are enforced through a
contract signed when a user enters the system. The user agrees to accept changes
made by rule 3.

1. The delegation tree with the most voters wins (simple majority). (M)
2. A necessary condition (constraint) is the balance of resources. (M)
3. Constitutional rules can be changed by 80% of registered voters. (M)
4. All value and labor has to be tracked in the system (referential
   transparency). (L, M)
5. The winning plan describes a binding execution plan for resource assignment.
   Each voter of this plan is bound to the commitments made at plan activation.
   (M, L)
6. All persons interacting with a running plan have the right of membership
   after a period of 3 months. Registration is to be executed by the winning
   plan and has to be complete for plan fulfillment. (L)
7. Each task has a manager who is responsible for successful task completion.
   The manager must be voting for the plan. Each worker working on a task has to
   be tracked. For external institutions or businesses workers can register in
   the system, if they can prove that they work(ed) for the task. (completeness)
   (L/M)
8. Redundant assignment to jobs are valid and are determined by the manager or
   system at plan activation. (M)
9. The human rights charter (UN) is applied. (L)

11. All created intellectual property has to be under a free license, either
    creative commons or FSFE approved. Data is managed to protect the privacy of
    individual persons and ensure 9. All collected data in the tasks has to be
    made available for plan analysis and optimization algorithms (scheduling,
    prediction) freely and with reasonable amount of effort. (L)
10. The planning period is 3 months. Plan activation happens automatically at
    each quarter year. (M)
11. Tasks for which the start conditions cannot be fulfilled are blocked by the
    plan and are not executed. An insurance mechanism allows to activate backup
    plans to unblock it at any time when the plan is active. (M)
12. Unless any of the constitutional rules is broken, plan execution has to
    conform to the jurisdiction it is operating in. In case of conflict the plan
    should not be executed. (conformity) (L)
13. A 80% majority of all voters can veto a plan and halt its official
    execution. (M) Voters are bound to veto a plan if it is illegal due to the
    constitutional rules or the jurisdiction it is operating in. (safety) (L)
14. Each task should be flagged as sustainable if it is reproducible for at
    least a million times and does not pollute the environment due to current
    knowledge. (L)
